### Meeting notes from Mozlando 2018.

https://github.com/servo/webrender/wiki/2018-Mozlando

Quote from WR API roadmap:

> Rewrite WR API to accept 3 trees instead of a single display list:
>
> - spatial tree (reference, scroll and sticky frames) <br>
> - clip tree (tree of clip nodes, with a clip chain defined by a path to the tree root)
> - item tree (with nodes being the stacking contexts only, and leafs being items)

Which can be relevant for the project

## ReactNative

There is an effort within the react native community that aims to achieve several goals:

1. Make react-native core smaller in terms of number of components
2. move to `import {View} from 'react-native'`. Which can potentially be used with other bundlers.
3. Simplify architecture 3 threads -> 2 threads model with sync interactions. aka React Fabric
4. Make other platforms 1st class citizens (windows + macOS + web?). That involves rewriting a lot of native code in c++

A combination of all of these ideas might make react-native a potentially appealing direction to explore once all these pieces are in place. Or alternatively use this project as a basis for a react-native platform implementation.

**NOTE: currently there is no plans to implement react-native backend within this project.**
