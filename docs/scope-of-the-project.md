# Scope of the project
The point of this project is to provide platform for developing desktop and TV applications in a way which is familiar to web developers but not necessarily the same.

The table below provides a bit more info but in general:
  - you are expected to use **modern IDE**, preferrably with type-checking because we are doing very little validation
  - deprecated/exotic features are generally not supported at all
  - if it can be easily replaced with JS it's probably out-of-scope for now
  - popular libraries are expected to run fine eventually (if not already)
  - there's always `WebView` if you need it

## Notable limitations
The table below provides some info about what's left out. Some of those might be available in deno and/or provided by some external modules.
